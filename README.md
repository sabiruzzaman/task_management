## 🚀 Figma Challenge: Task Management UI in Flutter 🎨📱

Today, I took on the challenge of designing and developing a Task Management UI in Flutter! This includes:</br>

✅ Home Page</br>
✅ Task Page</br>
✅ Notification Page</br>
✅ Search Page</br>
✅ Add Task Page</br>

The goal is to create a clean, intuitive, and efficient task management experience. From smooth UI interactions to effective state management, every detail counts! 💡</br>
